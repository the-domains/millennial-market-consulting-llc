Welcome to MMC's brand new website! In the coming weeks, our site will be built from the ground up, so please bear with us as we work on this daunting task!

Millennial Market Consulting was founded to bring information to companies large and small, information that will be indispensable in this day and age-- the age of Millennials. Millennials are those who were born around the turn of the millennium, and are the next large generation following the "Baby Boomers." As the Baby Boomer generation grows older and older, the Millennial generation grows larger and larger. Millennials are becoming adults (or are already in their 20's and 30's), so it would behoove companies and businesses to change their traditional marketing techniques and campaigns to better suit the majority of the consumer population. This is what Millennial Market Consulting will aim to do-- provide expert advice and information on best business and marketing practices to reach this new generation, thus increasing your clientele and your profit margins!

I look forward to working with you after my business is completely up and running!

-Kaleb Wynne, Owner & Consultant of MMC
